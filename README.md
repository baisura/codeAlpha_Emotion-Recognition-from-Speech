 Emotion Recognition from Speech using Deep Learning
This project aims to classify emotions (Happy, Angry, Sad, Neutral, Surprise) from speech audio using Deep Learning and Speech Processing techniques.

🔹 Key Steps:
1️⃣ Dataset Preparation – Uses datasets like RAVDESS, CREMA-D.
2️⃣ Audio Preprocessing – Converts audio to MFCC features.
3️⃣ Model Selection – CNN-LSTM for extracting spatial and temporal patterns.
4️⃣ Training & Evaluation – Achieves 85-90% accuracy.
5️⃣ Real-Time Emotion Detection – Uses Microphone input for live emotion recognition.

🚀 Tech Stack:
✅ Librosa (Audio Processing)
✅ TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)
✅ Sounddevice (Real-Time Recording)
